# Hi, I am Jigme Tashi Namgyal

_Software engineer based in Thimphu, Bhutan_ <br>
_Studying BS in Computer Science in ADA University, Baku_<br>

Hey 👋,

So, picture this: I'm JTN, your friendly neighborhood software engineer hailing from the mystical land of Bhutan 🇧🇹. Now, I didn't exactly come out of the womb typing code, but let me tell you, I've come a long way since high school!

In the early days, I was like a kid in a candy store, trying every tech flavor in the book, learning something new for a solid 4-5 hours every day. But then, college came knocking, and well, I got a bit too comfy. Lazy days, you know? So, I pulled a classic move and took a gap year to whip myself into shape.

But oh, the job hunt! It was like hunting unicorns. Companies wanted degrees or experience, and I had neither. Three long months of struggle, and finally, I landed a junior rails backend gig in a Swiss-based company. And guess what? I ended up running the show on a telecom CRM in just a week! From there, I danced my way through CPQ products, resource management, and ATS.

Two years later, I jetted off to Japan, this time as a technical lead. I had to roll up my sleeves and dive into the deep end, learning devops, managing teams, and cooking up APIs in Golang from scratch. It was like being handed a Rubik's Cube, and I was determined to solve it!

Now, you might say I'm the bee's knees of backend development. 🐝 My grand vision? To build something extraordinary for myself and my community. I juggled three jobs, moonlighted as a student, and even tried my hand at startups (which, well, were more like shooting stars). But my passion for creating, for the community, and for a good laugh (like this) never wavered.

So, dear hiring manager, if you're on the lookout for someone who can spin code magic, lead teams like leader, and bring a smile to your face, look no further. I'm your software sorcerer, ready to embark on the next epic adventure! 🚀🤓
